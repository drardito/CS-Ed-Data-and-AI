### Week 1 - Setting the table/Diving In

This week will lay the foundation of everything that is to follow.

Here is what you will do this week:

1. **Review the Course.** Be sure to look over (and bookmark) the course [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/drardito/CS-Ed-Data-and-AI/tree/main) Start with the [landing page](https://github.com/drardito/CS-Ed-Data-and-AI/blob/main/Exploring%20Data%20and%20AI%20in%20Education.md).

2. **Getting set up** with resources and tools. Locate the books mentioned here (and bookmark them for easy access); explore the web resources; and download/install Python and R, and their associated IDEs. And don't forget to join [our Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/newworkspace-kbf1630/shared_invite/zt-1vx3yccpi-nki_qF3DAD~AFsKTgelqRQ). Once you get set up, please post your intentions for this course to the #data-and-education channel.

3. **Reading.** Please read [this brief article](https://slate.com/technology/2019/10/gender-binary-nonbinary-code-databases-values.html?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=traffic&utm_source=article&utm_content=web_share) about how data structures relate to gender identities in computer systems and in real life. By the way, if this article interests you, you might have a look at [this talk by the author, Meredith Broussard.](https://youtu.be/DP0cuUOXS6Q)

4. **Play with Python and R**. Now that you have set yourself up to write Python and R code, it's time to roll up our sleeves and start coding. Here's what to do:

   | Coding Language | Resource(s)                                                  | Assignment                                                   |
   | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | Python          | [Python Data Visualization Tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-do-visualization-using-python-from-scratch-651304b5ee7a) | Work through this entire tutorial. Remember to create artifacts of and reflections on your learning – both the things that worked and those that didn't work. |
   | R               | [R for Data Science, chapter 3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) | Work through the the various tools and examples in Chapter 3. Remember to create artifacts of and reflections on your learning – both the things that worked and those that didn't work. |

   

5. **Visualizing Data with Common Objects**.

   Too often we think of data visualization as a technological process instead of a human one. So, your task is to find some data that are of some interest to you (they can be education related or not). Then you will create at least two ways of visualizing these data using everyday objects. (This example from [Flowing Data](https://flowingdata.com/2018/04/17/visualizing-differences/)). Play around, be creative, share your creations.



### Week 2 - Manipulating and Exploring Data in Python and R.

### Week 5 - Your Data Analysis and Visualization Project

For four final project, you will locate and manipulate and visualize educational data. The type of data you select is completely up to you. However, I strongly suggest using very large data sets, as they are the most ripe for manipulation/reorganization and the exploration of big questions.
