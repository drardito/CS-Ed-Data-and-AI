### Week 1 - Setting the table/Diving In

This week will lay the foundation of everything that is to follow.

Here is what you will do this week:

1. **Getting set up** with resources and tools. Locate the books mentioned here (and bookmark them for easy access); explore the web resources; and download/install Python and R, and their associated IDEs. 

2. **Play with Python and R**. Now that you have set yourself up to write Python and R code, it's time to roll up our sleeves and start coding. Here's what to do:

   | Coding Language | Resource(s)                                                  | Assignment                                                   |
   | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | Python          | [Python Data Visualization Tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-do-visualization-using-python-from-scratch-651304b5ee7https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-do-visualization-using-python-from-scratch-651304b5ee7aa) | Work through this entire tutorial. Remember to create artifacts of your learning – both the things that worked and those that didn't work. |
   | R               | [R for Data Science, chapter 3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) | Work through the the various tools and examples in Chapter 3. Remember to create artifacts of your learning – both the things that worked and those that didn't work. |

   

3. **Visualizing Data with Common Objects**.

   Too often we think of data visualization as a technological process instead of a human one. So, your task is to find some data that are of some interest to you (they can be education related or not). Then you will create a way of visualizing these data using everyday objects. (This example from [Flowing Data](https://flowingdata.com/2018/04/17/visualizing-differences/)). Play around, be creative, share your creations.
