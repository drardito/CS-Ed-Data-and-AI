### Essential Questions/Learning Objectives

#### Essential Questions

The goal of this course is to do a deep dive into data and data visualization in the fields of education and teaching. This work is shaped by a set of Essential Questions:

- What kinds of data make up/inform our lives as educators and learners?
- What can data tell us about teaching and learning?
- How can data analysis analysis and visualization tools reveal deeper insights into teaching and learning?

#### Learning Objectives

The course has several learning objectives:

- To become aware of and familiar with the various types of data that make up/inform our lives as educators and learners.
- To become proficient in tool used to perform data analysis and visualization – primary Python and R.
- To perform our own detailed and nuanced data analysis and visualization on data important to us.
- To design learning experiences for K-12 learners that bring them powerfully in the world of data analysis and visualization.

This course is designed to support your own learning, and so, ultimately, the course will be shaped by you. With that in mind, I have created an initial structure to get us started. You can see the full Course Outline here.

1. Week 1 - Setting the table/Diving In.
2. Week 2 - Exploring Educational Data/Getting Started with Data Analysis in Python and R.
3. Week 3 - Visualizing Educational Data/Getting Started with Data Analysis in Python and R.
4. Week 4 - Your Data Analysis and Visualization Project.
5. Week 5 - The Home Stretch. Finishing up your data analysis and visualization project.

#### Coding Tools

Since Python and R are so widely used, there are many, many tools (both desktop and cloud apps) with which to program. Here are some to start with:

##### Python

Python is one of the most popular programming languages and has very powerful tools (libraries) for dealing with and visualizing data. There are also many IDEs (integrated development environments) available for Python.

[Anaconda.](https://www.anaconda.com) Anaconda is an integrated set of tools for data science, and is available for all operating systems.

[Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org). Spyder is a Python IDE that is very powerful and straightforward.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). VSC is a really flexible and extensible coding IDE.



##### R/RStudio

[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) is really the gold standard for working with R. It is available for any operating system. There is also a cloud version as well, called [PositCloud.](https://posit.cloud)

#### Books

1. [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) - This book is freely available on the web. From the publisher: *"R4DS teaches you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it."*

I have used this book in my own work and in enrichment programs with high school students.

2. [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/). This book is also freely available on the web. From the publisher: *Python is a first-class tool mainly because of its libraries for storing, manipulating, and gaining insight from data. Several resources exist for individual pieces of this data science stack, but only with the Python Data Science Handbook do you get them all—IPython, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and other related tools.*

I have used parts of this book and have found it really useful.

#### Web Resources

There are many, many great resources on the web to support your development as data scientists. Here are some I have used and found extremely helpful.

1. [Towards Data Science.](https://towardsdatascience.com) This is really a hub for all things Data Science - tutorials, trips, theory, etc..
2. [Flowing Data.](https://flowingdata.com) This is a great website run by Nathan Yau (whose book, [Visualize This](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470944889/braipick-20), is awesome). Flowing Data is full of Data Science and Data Visualization resources.

#### Data

There are many sources of data related to education to explore and play with. Here are some with which you can get started.

1. [National Center for Education Statistics (US)](https://nces.ed.gov). It is exactly what you would imagine it to be - a clearinghouse for all kinds of data sets (and associated reports) related to education. In addition to data sets, there are also some data tools to play with.
2. [Data.Gov](https://data.gov). This is a repository of open data from the U.S. Government. 
3. [New York State Department of Education (NYSED) Data.](https://data.nysed.gov) This site contains large data sets about students, schools, and colleges in New York State.
