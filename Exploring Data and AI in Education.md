## What are we up to?

This summer we will be diving deeply into two topics: 

1) Data and Education; and 

2) AI and Education.

In each, we will start by **reviewing** [the set of NYSED Computer Science/Digital Fluency Learning Standards](https://github.com/drardito/CS-Ed-Data-and-AI/blob/main/New%20York%20State%20Computer%20ScienceDigital%20Fluency%20Learning%20Standards.md) that address each of these areas.

Then, we will do an **assessment of our own individual skills** in being proficient (and possibly masterful in each).

Next, each of us will **create a plan** that gets us to the desired depth and proficiency for being able to deal effectively with Data and AI.

Lastly, each of us will **produce and share artifacts** that demonstrate this proficiency (and mastery).



## How will we be working individually and together?

Each of our explorations will have the same general structure:

***Readings*** - some will come from me; some will come from you)

***Learning Standards*** - you will (re)acquaint yourselves with the relevant NYSED Learning Standards)

***Skills*** - I will outline the key skills involved in each area; you can add to these as you see fit

***Artifacts of Your Journey*** - You will create and share a set of artifacts from your explorations

***Learning Activities ***- You will design learning activities for each grade level (elementary, middle school, high school) in each area

***Sharing/Reflecting** -
