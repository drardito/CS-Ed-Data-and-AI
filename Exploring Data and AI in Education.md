## What are we up to?

This summer we will be diving deeply into two topics: 

1) Data and Education; and 

2) AI and Education.

In each, we will start by **reviewing** [the set of NYSED Computer Science/Digital Fluency Learning Standards](https://github.com/drardito/CS-Ed-Data-and-AI/blob/main/New%20York%20State%20Computer%20ScienceDigital%20Fluency%20Learning%20Standards.md) that address each of these areas.

Then, we will do an **assessment of our own individual skills** in being proficient (and possibly masterful in each).

Next, each of us will **create a plan** that gets us to the desired depth and proficiency for being able to deal effectively with Data and AI.

Lastly, each of us will **produce and share artifacts** that demonstrate this proficiency (and mastery).



## How will we be working individually and together?

Each of our explorations will have the same general structure:

***Readings*** - Some will come from me; some will come from you.

***Learning Standards*** - you will (re)acquaint yourselves with the relevant [NYSED Learning Standards.](https://github.com/drardito/CS-Ed-Data-and-AI/blob/main/New%20York%20State%20Computer%20ScienceDigital%20Fluency%20Learning%20Standards.md)

***Skills*** - I will outline the key skills involved in each area; you can add to these as you see fit.

***Coding*** - We will be using coding tools in our work. At minimum, you will be using *Python* and *R*, which are two of the mostly commonly used programming languages for dealing with data and data visualization.

***Artifacts of Your Journey*** - You will create and share a set of artifacts from your explorations

***Learning Activities*** - You will design learning activities for each grade level (elementary, middle school, high school) in each area.

***Sharing/Reflecting*** - As you are working through things, you will share and reflect on what you are doing and learning.

***Slack Channel*** - I have set us up with a [Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/newworkspace-kbf1630/shared_invite/zt-1vx3yccpi-nki_qF3DAD~AFsKTgelqRQ) so we can stay in easy communication with one another. 



The tools you use to create and share your work are entirely up to you. My preference would be in the direction of tools that allow commenting and/or collaboration. That being said, it's your work, and so I will live with whatever works best for you. Please keep in mind that you will be sharing *text* and *code* and *images*, at the minimum.
