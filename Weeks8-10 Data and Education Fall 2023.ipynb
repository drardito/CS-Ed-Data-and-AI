    "Now that you have been working with spreadsheet tools like Excel and Google Sheets to perform data analyses and data visualizations, we will return to our old friend, R.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this work, we will use working in the 2nd edition of the great book, [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). For this exploration, we will be working through most of the first two sections: *Whole Game* and *Visualize*. I chose this text because like the Text Mining book, it makes great use of *tidy* tools. The goal is for you to some of the tools available in R to import, reorganize, and visualize various kinds of data. Then, as you did in last week's work, you will apply what you have learned to education data that is of interest to you.\n",

    "## Data Analysis/Visualization in R\n",
    "\n",
    "For this work, we will explore and play with the first two sections of the book, *Whole Game* and *Visualize*. The section *Whole Game* is a survey of the basic kinds of data analysis tasks and functions most commonly used for this kind of work, such as importing, transforming, and tidying data for analysis. The second *Visualize* (surprise, surprise) is a survey of basic kinds of methods of visualizing data. I think you will find both will build nicely on the R skills and techniques you have already explored.\n",

    "1. *Exploration*. Please work through each of the parts of this section of the book (2 Data Visualization, 3 Workflow:basics, etc.). As you do try all the examples and exercises. Keep track of the code you generate, samples of the output from that code, and any error messages you received and how you work to debug/troubleshoot them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Sharing*. Please be sure to collect artifacts of your work for this section of the book, along with a reflection(s) that discusses the work you have done there.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that you have acquired some data analysis and visualization skills using R, it is time for you to take these skills for a test drive. For this test drive, we will once again use some education focused data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this work, please go to the [New York State Department of Education Data website](https://data.nysed.gov/) or the [US Government Data Website - Data.Gov](https://data.gov/). Take a look at the datasets available, and pick one of interest to you.\n",

    "You will continue share your analysis and reflections using the same document you began for the Week 1 work. Be as generous as you can with your sharing -- show pictures, notes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are set up in Slack, please share your reflections on the texts and your data analysis and visualization work in the #learining-about-data-and-education channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to respond to one another and/or ask questions there as well.\n",
